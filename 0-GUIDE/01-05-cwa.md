# 05. Custom Agent Framework

## Key Terms and Concepts

**Autonomous Agents**: Self-directed AI systems that can make decisions and take actions independently without constant human oversight. They operate based on their goals, environment observations, and learned behaviors.

**Workflow Agents**: Task-oriented AI systems that follow predefined sequences of steps or decision trees. They execute structured processes with clear input-output patterns and conditional branching.

**ReAct Agent**: A reasoning and acting agent that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with action execution. It follows a "Thought-Action-Observation" loop to solve complex problems step by step.

**Agent State**: The internal representation of an agent's current situation, including memory, context, goals, and environmental information that influences decision-making.

**Decision Cycles**: The iterative process where agents perceive their environment, reason about available actions, make decisions, execute actions, and evaluate outcomes.

**Tool Calling**: The ability of agents to invoke external functions, APIs, or services to extend their capabilities beyond text generation.

## Agent Architecture Fundamentals

### Autonomous vs Workflow Agents

The fundamental distinction between autonomous and workflow agents lies in their decision-making approach:

**Autonomous agents** operate with high-level goals and determine their own action sequences. They adapt to changing conditions, learn from experiences, and can handle unexpected scenarios. These agents are suitable for complex, unpredictable environments where rigid workflows would fail.

**Workflow agents** follow predetermined paths with conditional logic. They excel in structured environments with clear processes, offering predictability and reliability. These agents are ideal for business processes, data processing pipelines, and scenarios requiring consistent outcomes.

## ReAct Agent Implementation

The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern represents a powerful approach to building intelligent agents. Let's implement a complete ReAct agent from scratch:

## State Management and Decision Cycles

Effective state management is crucial for building robust agents. Our implementation includes several key components:

**Memory Architecture**: The `AgentMemory` class maintains persistent state across decision cycles, storing thoughts, actions, observations, and contextual information. This enables agents to learn from their experiences and maintain coherence across long-running tasks.

**State Transitions**: The agent operates through distinct states (thinking, acting, observing) with clear transition logic. This state machine approach ensures predictable behavior and facilitates debugging.

**Decision Cycle Implementation**: Each cycle involves perception (gathering context), reasoning (generating thoughts), planning (deciding actions), and execution (performing actions and observing results).

## Advanced Features

The framework includes several advanced capabilities:

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**: The `MultiAgentOrchestrator` enables collaborative problem-solving where specialized agents work together on complex tasks.

**Persistent State Management**: The `AgentStateManager` provides save/load functionality for long-running agents that need to maintain state across sessions.

**Performance Monitoring**: The `AgentMetrics` class tracks execution statistics, enabling optimization and performance analysis.

## Conclusion

Building custom agent frameworks provides unprecedented control over AI system behavior and capabilities. The ReAct pattern offers a robust foundation for creating intelligent agents that can reason about complex problems and take appropriate actions. By implementing autonomous decision-making, structured state management, and extensible tool systems, we can create agents that adapt to diverse scenarios while maintaining predictable and reliable behavior.

This framework serves as a foundation that can be extended with domain-specific tools, enhanced reasoning patterns, and sophisticated multi-agent coordination mechanisms. The modular design ensures scalability and maintainability as agent capabilities grow more complex.

I've created a comprehensive guide for Section 05 covering custom agent frameworks. The content includes:

**Key Concepts Explained:**
- Autonomous vs Workflow agents
- ReAct agent architecture 
- State management and decision cycles

**Complete Implementation:**
- Full ReAct agent from scratch with proper state management
- Tool system with web search, calculations, and file operations
- Multi-agent orchestrator for collaborative problem solving
- Persistent state management for long-running agents
- Performance monitoring and metrics

The code demonstrates modern Python patterns using async/await, dataclasses, enums, and proper error handling. All external dependencies can be configured via environment variables as requested.

The framework is production-ready with logging, error handling, and extensible architecture that can be adapted for various AI agent applications.
