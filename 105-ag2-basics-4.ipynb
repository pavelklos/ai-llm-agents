    "- **Group chat**: A chat with more than two agents with options on how agents are selected. See GroupChat Overview for further details.\n",
    "- **Nested chat**: A mechanism to package a workflow into a single agent/chat for reuse in a workflow.\n",
    "- **Swarm**: A pattern based on agents with handoffs. There’s a shared context and each agent has tools and the ability to transfer control to other agents. The original swarm concept was created by OpenAI."

      "\n",
      "**Topic:** Introduction to AI Agents\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Grade Level:** 4th Grade\n",
      "\n",
      "**Standards:**\n",
      "- ISTE Standards for Students 4. a \n",
      "- CSTA K-12 Computer Science Framework 2-AP-10 \n",
      "\n",
      "**Objectives:**\n",
      "1. Students will explain the basic functions of AI agents and how they can solve everyday problems.\n",
      "2. Students will create a simple algorithm to guide an AI agent in completing a specific task.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lesson Structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**\n",
      "   - Begin with a brief video or presentation introducing AI agents. (Use visuals and relatable examples, like virtual assistants, chatbots, etc.)\n",
      "   - Engage students with a question: \"Can anyone think of a time when they've interacted with an AI?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Direct Instruction (15 minutes)**\n",
      "   - Define AI agents and outline their functions: data processing, responding to commands, and problem-solving.\n",
      "   - Discuss the role of algorithms in guiding AI behavior. Use simple examples to illustrate the concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Group Activity (20 minutes)**\n",
      "   - Divide students into small groups and give each group a scenario where they would need an AI agent (e.g., organizing their homework, planning a birthday party).\n",
      "   - Each group will outline the steps (algorithm) an AI agent could take to solve the problem at hand. \n",
      "   - Groups present their algorithms to the class, fostering discussion on the different approaches taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Individual Activity (15 minutes)**\n",
      "   - Students will individually create a flowchart for their own AI agent to complete a specific task of their choice.\n",
      "   - Provide a template with symbols for start/end, processes, and decisions to assist with flowchart creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion (10 minutes)**\n",
      "   - Review the concept of AI agents and algorithms.\n",
      "   - Engage the students with exit tickets: one thing they learned about AI and one question they still have.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assessment:\n",
      "- Formative: Observation during group discussions and reviewing group algorithms.\n",
      "- Summative: Evaluate individual flowcharts for understanding of algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Materials Needed:\n",
      "- Video/presentation materials on AI\n",
      "- Whiteboard and markers for group presentations\n",
      "- Flowchart templates and markers/pens\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adjustments:\n",
      "- Consider differentiation strategies for varying learning abilities, such as providing additional visual aids or pairing students for collaboration.\n",
      "- Incorporate technology by using coding apps or online platforms where students can experiment with basic coding concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’d like to gather feedback on any additional components or adjustments that might make this plan more engaging or effective. What recommendations do you have?\n",

      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorporate Real-World Examples:**\n",
      "   - Include examples of AI agents that students may already be familiar with, such as Siri, Alexa, or educational games that utilize AI to adapt to student behavior. This could help deepen their understanding and increase interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interactive Games:**\n",
      "   - Consider including an interactive coding game that allows students to \"program\" a character or robot to perform actions. Websites like Code.org or LightBot provide engaging platforms for this purpose. This provides a hands-on experience with algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Guest Speaker:**\n",
      "   - If possible, invite a local tech professional or a teacher specializing in computer science to talk about how AI is used in different fields. This could give students real-world context and inspire interest in technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integration with Writing:**\n",
      "   - After the flowchart activity, encourage students to write a brief narrative on how their AI agent would approach the problem, integrating creativity with their understanding of algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Programming Tools:**\n",
      "   - Introduce students to basic programming languages or visual block-based coding tools (like Scratch or Tynker) where they could prototype their AI agents digitally after the lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Reflective Journals:**\n",
      "   - Have students maintain a reflective journal throughout the unit where they can jot down their thoughts on AI, lessons learned, and their ideas for future applications of AI agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Extension Activities:**\n",
      "   - For students who finish early or want to explore further, provide resources or activities about advanced AI concepts, such as machine learning or how AI agents are used in robotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Collaborative Learning:**\n",
      "   - Implement a jigsaw approach where each group researches a different type of AI or application, then teaches their findings to the rest of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assessment Diversification:**\n",
      "   - Beyond individual flowcharts, consider having students create a multimedia presentation or a digital poster to showcase their group’s algorithm and overall problem-solving process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Follow-Up Lesson:**\n",
      "   - Plan a follow-up lesson that dives deeper into coding and programming concepts using platforms suitable for their age, reinforcing the connection between algorithms and programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "By incorporating these elements, you will not only enhance student engagement but also deepen their understanding of AI agents and the algorithms that power them.
