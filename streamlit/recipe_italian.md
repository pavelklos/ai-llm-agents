    ## Cooking Instructions
    ## Cooking Instructions:

### Step 1: Boil the Pasta
1. **Bring water to a boil:** In a large pot, fill it with water (about 4-5 quarts) and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.
2. **Cook the pasta:** Add 250g of whole wheat pasta to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook according to package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes, until al dente. 
3. **Drain and set aside:** Once cooked, reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta in a colander. Set aside.

### Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables
4. **Heat the oil:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
5. **Add garlic:** Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic (3 cloves) and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant, but not browned.
6. **Cook the vegetables:** Add the diced zucchini (1 medium) and bell pepper (1 medium) to the skillet. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until they start to soften, then add the halved cherry tomatoes (200g). Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes start to blister.

### Step 3: Combine and Finish
7. **Add spinach:** Stir in the fresh spinach (100g) and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until wilted.
8. **Combine with pasta:** Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Toss everything together, adding some reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the mixture.
9. **Season:** Season with salt, black pepper to taste, and red pepper flakes (if using) for a bit of heat.
10. **Add fresh herbs:** Finally, stir in a handful of fresh basil leaves just before serving.

### Step 4: Serve
11. **Plate the dish:** Serve the pasta hot, garnishing with grated Parmesan cheese (50g) if desired. Enjoy your healthy vegetarian pasta dish!

### Tips for Best Results:
- Make sure your skillet is hot enough before adding the garlic to prevent it from becoming bitter.
- Feel free to use any seasonal vegetables you have on hand, such as asparagus or peas.
- For added protein, consider tossing in some chickpeas or white beans.
