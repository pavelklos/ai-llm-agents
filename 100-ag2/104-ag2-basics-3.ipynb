      "3. **Alternative Assessment Methods**: In addition to the short written reflection, consider incorporating other forms of assessment, such as peer feedback for their group presentations or a small group discussion where they can articulate what they learned.\n",

      "4. **Real-World Connection**: You might want to add a short discussion or video about local ecosystems or conservation efforts in your community. This can help students relate the topic to their own lives and foster a sense of responsibility towards the environment.\n",

It offers opportunities for hands-on activities, such as creating a model ecosystem or conducting a simple investigation about local habitats. Students can learn about different ecosystems (like forests, deserts, oceans, etc.), the organisms that inhabit them, and the importance of biodiversity and conservation.
