      "4. **Real-World Connection**: You might want to add a short discussion or video about local ecosystems or conservation efforts in your community. This can help students relate the topic to their own lives and foster a sense of responsibility towards the environment.\n",

Students can learn about different ecosystems (like forests, deserts, oceans, etc.), the organisms that inhabit them, and the importance of biodiversity and conservation.
